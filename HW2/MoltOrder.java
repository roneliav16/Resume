/*
MoltOrder.java represents a single order made by a customer.
Each Object stores details about what is being ordered from Molt Delivery,
the customerâ€™s name, how long it takes to drive to the customer, etc..

This class implements the interface Comparable<MoltOrder>.
This means it is required to have a function compareTo which takes another MoltOrder as a parameter,
and determines which of the two MoltOrders should be handled before the other.

The MoltOrder whose priority value is lower should be handled first,
and should thus be considered the smaller one by the compareTo function.
If you are not familiar with how the return value of compareTo represents which object is smaller,
you should read into the topic before implementing that part of the code.
